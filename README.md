Raja Ram Chandra Ki Jai

Rajputana Rifles - They come from the land of the braves. The Rajputs have an illustrious and extremely rich history of courage, and have displayed indomitable spirit and resoluteness in extreme adversity. They constantly thwarted Islamic invasions before the eventual conquest of the nation by the invaders. Yet even the invaders recognised the valour of the Rajputs and formed alliances with them. As time progressed, the Rajputs became part of the British Indian Army before eventually finding their rightful place in the Indian Army.
